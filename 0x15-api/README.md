# API Data Transformation Project

## Overview

This project is designed to demonstrate how to transform data from a list of dictionaries retrieved from an API. The script processes the data, extracts relevant fields, and formats them into a new list of dictionaries.

## Project Structure

- `3-dictionary_of_list_of_dictionaries.py`: The main Python script for transforming the data.
- `data.json`: A sample JSON file used for testing (optional, if you have one).
- `README.md`: This file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
