HTTPS/SSL: Inasmuch as the URL begins with https, then it means that SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) connection is created. The server gives a stamp that a browser can check to start an encrypted session.

Load-Balancer: Load balancers are applied in Google to divide the incoming traffic among several servers. That is a way of managing the load and guaranteeing that high performance and reliability will always be achieved.

Web Server: The request gets to a Google web server that handles it by serving other static files such as HTML files, CSS, JavaScripts among others.

Application Server: For dynamic content the request is forwarded to an application server where server side of scripting occurs and interaction with databases takes place.
